# Requirements

## User Needs

### User stories
TODO: Write brief user stories to explain how various actors would interact with the system to accomplish a goal.
    Express these in the form from agile development:- As a (role) I want (goal) so that (benefit).

    As an electric vehicle driver I want to use an app so that I can locate the nearest charging point
    As an electric vehicle driver I want to know when I am near a electric vehicle charging point so that I can charge my vehicle

### Actors
TODO: List and describe the actors/users for this product:
 
Electric vehical driver: Someone who both owns and drives a vehicle powered by electricity

### Use Cases
TODO: Describe each use case (at least one per team member).
    Give each use case a unique ID, e.g. UC1, UC2, ...
    Summarise these using the use-case template below.

| TODO: UC1        | TODO: Locate nearest EV charging point | 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** | TODO: Locate the nearest EV charging point to driver. |
| **Actors** | TODO: Electric vehical driver |
| **Assumptions** | TODO: Browser has geo locqtion</td></tr>
| **Steps** |      1. View table of EV charging points
|           |      2. Ask user for persmission to access their location
|           |      3. Give permission for geo-location
|           |      4. Retrieve nearest EV charging points from the database
|           |      5. View table of nearest EV charging points
| **Variations** | TODO: OPTIONAL - Any variations in the steps of a use case |
| **Non-functional** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of non-functional requirements that the use case must meet. |
| **Issues** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of issues that remain to be resolved |

| TODO: UC2        | TODO: USE-CASE NAME | 
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Description** | TODO: Locate the nearest EV charging point to driver. |
| **Actors** | TODO: Electric vehical driver |
| **Assumptions** | TODO: Browser has geo locqtion</td></tr>
| **Steps** |      1. View table of EV charging points
|           |      2. Ask user for persmission to access their location
|           |      3. Give permission for geo-location
|           |      4. Retrieve nearest EV charging points from the database
|           |      5. View table of nearest EV charging points
| **Variations** | TODO: OPTIONAL - Any variations in the steps of a use case |
| **Non-functional** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of non-functional requirements that the use case must meet. |
| **Issues** | TODO: OPTIONAL - List of issues that remain to be resolved |


TODO: Your Use-Case diagram should include all use-cases.

## Software Requirements Specification
### Functional requirements
TODO: create a list of functional requirements. 
    e.g. "The system shall ..."
    Give each functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. FR1, FR2, ...
    Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.


### Non-Functional Requirements
TODO: Consider one or more [quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9126) to suggest a small number of non-functional requirements.
Give each non-functional requirement a unique ID. e.g. NFR1, NFR2, ...

Indicate which UC the requirement comes from.
